# Markdown Bullet Capitalizer

## Overview

The Markdown Bullet Capitalizer is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the editing experience in Markdown files. It automatically capitalizes the first letter after bullet points, and provides a command to capitalize all such characters in an existing file.

## Features

1. **Automatic Capitalization On-the-Go:**
   - When typing in a Markdown file, the extension automatically capitalizes the first character following `*` or `-` bullet points.
2. **Capitalization Command for Entire File:**
   - A command is available to capitalize the first character after all `*` or `-` bullet points throughout the current Markdown file.

## How to Use

### Automatic Capitalization

- Just type as usual in your Markdown file.
- When you create a bullet point using `*` or `-` and type a character right after, the extension will automatically capitalize it.

### Capitalize Entire File

- Open a Markdown file in VSCode.
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
- Type and select "Capitalize Markdown List Items".
- This will capitalize the first character of all list items in the document.

## Installation

- Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
- Once installed, it will automatically activate when you open Markdown files.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.x
